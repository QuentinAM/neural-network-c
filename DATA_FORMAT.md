# Data format

Let's here suppose our network have 2 output and 3 input.
```sh
expected/expected|input|input|input
```
So for example
```sh
0/ 1 | 0| 0 |0 (0 and 1 are the expected ouputs and 0 0 0 the inputs)
```

# Test data format

Let's here suppose the same network as above.
Here the expected value are not necessary.
It is just to display the predicted values.
```sh
input|input|input
```
So for example
```sh
0| 0 |0
```

Space doesn't matter.
