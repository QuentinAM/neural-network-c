# üíª Neural network

Working on neural network libs in C

## üìà Advantages

- You'll be able to use the same code for different types of neural networks
- You'll be able to modify the code to fit your needs

## ‚öôÔ∏è [Usage](https://github.com/QuentinAM/neural-network-c/blob/main/src/main.c) (expectation)

```c
#include "network.h"

// Create a network with 1 hidden layer of 15 neurons to train on XOR
// Here XOR is just an exemple of usage

int main(void)
{
    // Neural network of 1 hidden layer with 15 neurons
    // Using sigmoid activation function
    // Using sigmoid prime activation function
    Network_args args = { .n_inputs = 2,
                          .n_outputs = 1,
                          .n_hidden_layers = 1,
                          .n_neurons_per_hidden_layer = 15,
                          .n_act_f = SIGMOID,
                          .n_act_f_prime = SIGMOID_PRIME };

    // Create the network
    Network *network = network_create(&args);

    size_t n_epochs = 10000;
    double n_learning_rate = 0.01;

    // Train the network on XOR
    network_train(network, n_epochs, n_learning_rate, "xor_data.txt");

    // Test the network on XOR
    network_test(network, "xor_test.txt");

    // Save the network
    network_save(network, "network.data");

    // Free the network
    network_free(network);
}
```

The code will be fully documented in the headers (.h) file in the include folder.
